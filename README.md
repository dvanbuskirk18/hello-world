I'm learning about git!

Hi, I'm Darcy. I am new to programming, to data science, to git, to pretty much all of it. But I have had a hunch for a long time that I may have missed my calling by not entering a computer science track in school. I'm thinking about a career change, so I'm starting to explore this option. We'll see how it goes!
